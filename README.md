# README CNIO Relion Tools

This is a collection of scripts that we use during cryoEM data collection and analysis with RELION. We find them very useful and we hope that you can find them useful too :) Enjoy!

- ice.py --> micrograph ice thickness/quality estimation
- png_out.py --> generation of png files from micrographs and ctf images
- relion_live.py --> LIVE feedback for On-The-Fly data processing with RELION (very useful to explore already processed datasets too!)
- relion_dashboard.py --> RELION metadata analysis

## Installation

### Relion

You should have a working installation of Relion 5.0 on your system.

### Creating conda environment

We encourage you to create a relion_dashboard conda environment that you can use to run these scripts

```bash
conda create -y -n relion_dashboard python=3.10
conda activate relion_dashboard
pip install pandas dash==2.6.2 starfile==0.4.10 pathlib2 numpy glob2 pathlib argparse seaborn regex dash-cytoscape==0.3.0 dash_bootstrap_components==1.4.0 flask==2.1.2 werkzeug==2.1.2
```

### Clone CNIO_Relion_Tools

Now, clone this repository to your favorite script folder or within the environment bin directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryoEM-CNIO/CNIO_Relion_Tools
```

*Add the location to your PATH or provide full path when using the tools.*

## Scheme for relion_it.py that includes ice estimation and pngs

![Alt text](pics/schemes_diagram.png)

We provide an example of a Schemes folder for relion_it.py that includes the jobs for ice thickness estimation, and png export for relion_live.py. Copy the Schemes folder to your working directory BEFORE running relion_it.py.

The PNG scheme is set apart from the PREP scheme so it doesn't slow down preprocessing. The default relion_it.py script won't lauch it. To launch the PNG scheme please follow either of these two options:

### 1. Edit relion_it.py and insert the following in line 943, right below the section for the PROC scheme

```python
    if options['do_png']:

        command = 'relion_schemer --scheme png --reset &'
        print(' RELION_IT: executing: ', command)
        os.system(command)

        command = 'relion_schemer --scheme png --run  --pipeline_control Schemes/png/ >> Schemes/png/run.out 2>> Schemes/png/run.err  &'
        print(' RELION_IT: executing: ', command)
        os.system(command)
        if do_gui:
            command = 'relion_schemegui.py png &'
            print(' RELION_IT: executing: ', command)
            os.system(command)
```

**Remember to include the option ```'do_png' : 'True',``` in your options.py file that you provide relion_it.py with.**

We include the example option file CNIO_Relion_Tools_options_TUTODATA.py

### 2. Execute directly in the terminal:

```bash
relion_schemer --scheme png --reset &
relion_schemer --scheme png --run  --pipeline_control Schemes/png/ >> Schemes/png/run.out 2>> Schemes/png/run.err  &
```

## Calculate relative ice thickness for each micrograph: *ice.py*

This script estimates ice-thickness for each micrograph in the input star file.
We use the data generated by CtfFind, so using CtfFind is a requierement.
The script sums the signal on the Ctf image in the 4-3.6 Å spatial frequency range.

This provides a simple and reasonable estimation of ice thickness that can be used for dataset initial cleanup and late stages data analysis (taking into account that the estimation is per-micrograph).

**1.** Activate conda environment BEFORE opening RELION's GUI

```bash
conda activate relion_dashboard
relion
```

**2.** Run ice.py as an external job type

- Executable: ice.py (provide full path if it is not in your PATH)

- Input micrograph star file: micrograph_ctf.star (it should be a star file with Ctf information from a CtfFind job!)

Ice thickness estimation is stored in the rlnMicrographIceThickness label

The output micrograph_ctf_ice.star file can be used for a manual selection (Subset Selection job type) or any other downstream job that you want to perform.

## RELION Live Dashboard: relion_live.py

This script provides LIVE feedback for On-The-Fly data processing with RELION

### Relion_Live Usage

Execute the script from your project directory
`relion_live.py`

*If the script is not in your PATH, use the full explicit path to the script.*

It admits two arguments (quite often the default parameters are ok):

- **--port**: choose the port were you want to launch the webapp (default: 8051)

- **--host**: choose the IP address where you want the webapp to be hosted (default: localhost).

Example:

```bash
relion_live.py --host 01.010.101.010 --port 8050
```

Open a web browser and access the server (localhost:8050)

### Displaying images for micrograph and CTF

In order for this to work, you need to create png files for every image and ctf in the motioncorr and ctffind folders, next to mrc/ctf files and with the same name.

To do this we use an external job type from the relion GUI to run **png\_out.py**

If you want to include it in your relion\_it.py schedule use the Schemes folder in this repository.

## Tools for relion data analysis: relion_analyse.py

Same instructions as above still apply.

This script launches a webapp to analyse in detail each RELION job in a given project. The webapp is organized in 6 different tabs:

- **Relion pipeline**: an overview of all the nodes in the project and their connectivity.

![Relion pipeline](pics/relion_analyse.png)

- **Analyse micrographs**: an interactive scatter plot to analyze any micrograph's parameter vs any other (especially useful in combination with <https://github.com/cryoEM-CNIO/CNIO_Ctf_Ice_Thickness>!).

![Analyse micrographs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60991432/179054307-012e224b-678a-473d-8c2e-a45916283e81.png)

- **Analyse particles**: an interactive scatter plot to analyze any set of particle's parameter vs any other.

![Analyse particles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60991432/179055092-08e31056-253b-4627-b4f1-0cec84d2f458.png)

- **Analyse 2D Classification**: a tab dedicated to analyse or follow in real time your 2D classifications, monitoring particle distribution per class and convergence.

![Analyse 2D Classification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60991432/179055437-d23cc833-016a-4820-858a-53aac1925df7.png)

- **Analyse 3D Classification**: follow the convergence of the classification, per-class distribution of particles and alignment in each iteration of 3D classifications.

- **Analyse 3D Refine**: follow in real time the convergence, angular distribution and FSC in each iteration.

Note that all plots are interactive. The ones in in the **Analyse particles** and **Analyse micrographs** tabs can also be used to select a subset of micrographs/particles graphically and export them as a .star file that can then be imported into RELION:

### Relion_Analyse Usage

**Execute the script from your project directory**
`conda activate relion_dashboard`
`relion_dashboard.py`

*If the script is not in your PATH, use the full explicit path to the script.*

It admits two arguments (quite often the default parameters are ok):

- **--port**: choose the port were you want to launch the webapp (default: 8051)

- **--host**: choose the IP address where you want the webapp to be hosted (default: localhost).

Example:

```bash
relion_dashboard.py --host 01.010.101.010 --port 8051
```
